## Analyzing Java with Moose 8

Moose is a platform in Pharo that can manipulate models of software, to facilitate analyses including software data mining. In this blog post, I will show you a few features of Moose to analyze a Java project.

## Analysis overview

Here's an overview of what I will show in this post:

![Overview of analysis process using Moose](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/svg/JO_13e9034Jl_OeUyHVmeZ6QI20XCH8l71eekhfioUv2ebzlGGxUEfatayukHF9nx2t0SW6a1okECQE9SF3ov2Pk8LraaD4tZ8sqN4DQaWyh5mLxUZ6UziNvXhtw5fEA_SJ6SRRHV74vOcVidCk5sfMH3l-APqn4EulPhA4J_uAqCc4aQpxyoq1IMdBnMkHQEnD8Tp9Ets6liaToPD_110KVv4KfTkrIfGjbW9rAtVi5)

Moose operates on *models* of software, namely FAMIX models. To analyze a Java project, you must first create a model of it using a Java-to-Famix parser. In this example, I will use [VerveineJ](https://github.com/moosetechnology/VerveineJ), but it's also possible to use [JDT2Famix](https://github.com/feenkcom/jdt2famix).

PlantUML is used to create class diagrams of the software in Moose (this is optional). For this post, I installed a local version of the PlantUML server, which also requires an installation of GraphViz. 

## Install Moose

To make this post, I used Moose 8 in Pharo 8, both of which were in development stage at the time of writing this. Here's a simple way to get it running:

- [Install the Pharo Launcher](http://pharo.org/download). 
- Create a copy of the image of Moose-8 from the Inria CI:
  **New Image Templates \> Moose Jenkins \> Moose 8 \> Latest successful build: #*nnn* \> Moose.zip PHARO=80 \> Create image**

## Clone the Java project you want to analyze

In this step, let's assume there is a GitHub repository of a Java project that we want to analyze, e.g., [the source code from Head First Design Patterns](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns).
In this step we need get a local copy of the source code using **git clone**.
For this post we will clone it in the Pharo image directory.

Open a Moose Playground (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>) in Pharo, and type the following:

```smalltalk
javaProjectFileRef := MooseEasyUtility cloneGitHubRepo: 
    'https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns'.
```

This will create a clone of the Java repo from GitHub in your Pharo working directory, in a relative path of `tmp/MooseEasyRepos/bethrobson__Head-First-Design-Patterns`. 

> Note that we are *not* using `Iceberg` to make this clone, but a `git clone` command run in a Bourne shell via [`LibC` in Pharo]({% post_url 2019-03-16-LibC-Pharo-experiments %}).

## Parse Java to make FAMIX model

Once we have a local copy (clone) of the source code, we can make the FAMIX model of it using a parser such as [VerveineJ](https://github.com/moosetechnology/VerveineJ). To install VerveineJ for our purposes, it's simple:

- Make sure a Java Runtime Environment (`java` command) is in the execution path of your system.
- Make a clone of the VerveineJ parser (which is itself a Java project on GitHub) with the following command in a Moose Playground:

```smalltalk
verveineJFileRef := MooseEasyUtility cloneGitHubRepo: 
    'https://github.com/moosetechnology/VerveineJ'.
```

> Note there is no need to compile VerveineJ, since its clone normally has the binary jar files.

There are two ways to do this. 

1. There is a user interface that can be run with the command `MooseEasyFamixMakerPresenter open` in a Moose Playground. You supply the paths to the source code, the VerveineJ parser script `verveinej.sh` and the destination MSE (FAMIX) file. Assuming the relative paths from the examples above, the Java source to parse is at `tmp/MooseEasyRepos/bethrobson__Head-First-Design-Patterns`, the VerveineJ parser is at `tmp/MooseEasyRepos/moosetechnology__VerveineJ/verveinej.sh` and we want the `HFDP.mse` file to be stored in `tmp`:
   
   ![Famix Maker Dialog]({{site.baseurl}}/img/posts/FamixMakerDialog.png){:class="img-responsive"}
2. There is a programmatic interface that can be run from Pharo code:
   ```smalltalk

   ```

## Load model of Java source

If you use the GUI, the following code is generated in the text box at the bottom of the dialog. Otherwise, you can copy it from here, changing the paths for the Java source and MSE files:

```smalltalk
"Load the moose Model with some error checking"
| mseFileRef mseStream mooseModel |
mseFileRef := 'tmp/HFDP.mse' asFileReference. "Generated by FamixMaker"
mseStream := mseFileRef readStream.
mseStream
	ifNotNil: [ 
		mooseModel := MooseModel importFromMSEStream: mseStream. 
		mooseModel install. "So it appears in the Panel"
		mseStream close. ]
	ifNil: [ self error: 'Could not load MSE file into Moose: ' , mseFileRef asString ].

```

## Visualize a package in PlantUML

The [PlantUML Pharo Gizmo](https://github.com/fuhrmanator/PlantUMLPharoGizmo) project has a GUI to visualize Moose models. You start the GUI with the following:

```smalltalk
Blah blah open
```

## Perform a Moose analysis using Pharo

The following analysis is one taken from [The Moose Book](http://themoosebook.org)...


## Conclusion

Thanks to the `Moose-Easy` tools shown in the post, Moose should be more accessible.
