## Analyzing Java with Moose

Moose is a platform in Pharo that can manipulate models of software, to facilitate analyses including software data mining. In this blog post, I will show you a few features of Moose to analyze a Java project.

## Analysis overview

Moose works with models of software, namely FAMIX models. To analyze a Java project, you must first create a model of it using a Java-to-Famix parser. In this example, I will use [VerveineJ](https://github.com/moosetechnology/VerveineJ), but it's also possible to use [JDT2Famix](https://github.com/feenkcom/jdt2famix).
