  abstract     = {Abstract Identifying and tracking evolving software structures at
	a design level is a challenging task. Although there are ways to
	visualize this information statically, there is a need for methods
	that help analyzing the evolution of software design elements. In
	this paper, we present a new visual approach to identify variability
	zones in software designs and explore how they evolve over time.
	To verify the usefulness of our approach, we did a user study in
	which participants had to browse software histories and find visual
	patterns. Most participants were able to find interesting observations
	and found our approach intuitive and useful. We present a number
	of design aspects that were observed by participants and the authors
	using our {IHVis} tool on four open-source projects.},

  abstract     = {We present a hybrid visualization technique for compound graphs (i.e.
	networks with a hierarchical clustering defined on the nodes) that
	combines the use of adjacency matrices, node-link and arc diagrams
	to show the graph, and also combines the use of nested inclusion
	and icicle diagrams to show the hierarchical clustering. The graph
	visualized with our technique may have edges that are weighted and/or
	directed. We first explore the design space of visualizations of
	compound graphs and present a taxonomy of hybrid visualization techniques.
	We then present our prototype, which allows clusters (i.e. subtrees)
	of nodes to be grouped into matrices or split apart using a radial
	menu. We also demonstrate how our prototype can be used in the software
	engineering domain, and compare it to the commercial matrix-based
	visualization tool Lattix using a qualitative user study.},
